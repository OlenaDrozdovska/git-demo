Edmund I (920/921–946) was King of the English from 939 until his death. He was a son of King Edward the Elder and his third wife Eadgifu, and a grandson of Alfred the Great. Edmund's predecessor and half-brother Æthelstan had become the first king of all England when he conquered Viking-ruled York in 927, but on his death Anlaf Guthfrithson seized control of York and north-east Mercia. Edmund recovered control over all England in 944. He continued his brother's friendly relations with Continental rulers; some were married to his half-sisters.
